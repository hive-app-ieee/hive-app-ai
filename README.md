# Hive app Recommendation system

Welcome to **Hive App**'s recommendation system, an AI algorithm that's implemented to enhance the functionality of the app and to give the users better and easier experience.

## System Overview

### Objective

The recommendation system targets predicting each user's favourite place to study or finish his/her work.

## System phases

This system comes at **two** phases:

### 1. Content-based filtering

At the launch stage we doesn't have many ratings to use it in recommendations. Here, the content-based filtering is used as it recommend the most suitable places from users preferences and workspaces/sharespaces ratings in the same preferences. This comes as a priliminary solution until the users ratings are available

We decided to use **euclidean distance** instead of cosine similarity as it's suitable for numerical data where the magnitude of differences matters.

### 2. Collaborative filtering

Soon this section will be launched



## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Pandas**: Python library for data manipulation.
- **Numpy**: Python library for mathematical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: for ML metrics and operations.
- **Jupyter notebook**: Programming Environment.
